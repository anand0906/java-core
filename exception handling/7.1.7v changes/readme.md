**1.7 Version Enhancements in Exception Handling**

As part of Java 1.7, the following two major features were introduced in exception handling:

---

### 1. Try with Resources

Until Java 1.6, it was mandatory to close resources (like file streams, readers, etc.) manually in the `finally` block, which increased code complexity:

```java
BufferedReader br = null;
try {
    br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("abc.txt"));
    // use br based on our requirements
} catch(IOException e) {
    // handling code
} finally {
    if(br != null)
        br.close();
}
```

#### Problems:

* Manual resource closing increases complexity.
* `finally` block is compulsory, increasing code length and reducing readability.

#### Java 1.7 Solution:

**Try-with-resources** automatically closes any resources declared in the try block once control leaves it (either normally or abnormally).

```java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("abc.txt"))) {
    // use br based on our requirements
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handling code
}
```

#### Key Points:

1. We can declare multiple resources using `;` separator:

```java
try (R1; R2; R3) {
    // code
}
```

2. All resources must implement `java.lang.AutoCloseable`.
3. Resources are **implicitly final**:

```java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("abc.txt"))) {
    br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("abc.txt")); // Compile-time Error
}
```

4. Unlike Java 1.6, `try` can now exist without `catch` or `finally`:

```java
try (Resource r) {
    // Valid in Java 1.7
}
```

5. `finally` block becomes optional as resource closing is automatic.

### 2. Multi-Catch Block

In Java 1.6, even if multiple exceptions had the same handling logic, separate catch blocks were required:

```java
try {
    // code
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (NullPointerException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (ClassCastException e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
```

#### Java 1.7 Solution:

With multi-catch block, you can group exceptions that share the same handling logic:

```java
try {
    // code
} catch (ArithmeticException | NullPointerException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (ClassCastException | IOException e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
```

#### Note:

* There should be **no inheritance relation** between the exceptions listed (no parent-child/same type), else you get a compile-time error.

**Example of Invalid Multi-Catch:**

```java
catch (Exception | IOException e) // Compile-time Error
```

Because `IOException` is a subclass of `Exception`.

### Exception Propagation

If an exception occurs inside a method and it is not handled there, it propagates to the caller method, which must handle it. This process is known as **Exception Propagation**.

---

### Rethrowing an Exception

Used to convert one exception type into another:

```java
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println(10/0);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            throw new NullPointerException();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
```

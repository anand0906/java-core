# ☕ Java Architecture🌐🛠️💡

Java architecture explains how Java programs are developed, compiled, and executed in a way that makes them work on any computer (**platform independent** 🖥️) and keeps them safe (**secure** 🔐).&#x20;

It shows the internal structure and how everything works together. ✨📦💻

## 🧩 Steps Involved in Java Architecture:

1. **✍️ Writing the Code:**

   * A programmer writes Java code and saves it with a `.java` file extension.
   * This code is written in a text editor or IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code.

2. **⚙️ Compilation (Using Java Compiler):**

   * The Java Compiler (`javac`) takes the `.java` file and compiles it.
   * It converts the code into an intermediate format called **Bytecode** 🔄.
   * Bytecode is saved in a `.class` file and is **platform-independent** 🧳, meaning it can run on any system with Java installed.

3. **🧠 Execution (Using JVM):**

   * The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** reads the Bytecode 📖.
   * The JVM converts the Bytecode into **machine code** ⚡ specific to the host system 🖥️.
   * This is done using an **interpreter** or a **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler** 🧮.

4. **🚀 Running the Program:**

   * The machine code is executed by the computer’s CPU 🧠.
   * The program runs and produces the desired output. ✅📊🎯
